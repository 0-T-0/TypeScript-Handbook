## Contributing
TypeScript-handbook is accepting contributions. Please make sure there is an issue tracking it in the issue tracker. Your pull request should include a link to the issue that you are fixing. If you've submitted a PR for an existing issue, please post a comment in the issue to avoid duplication of effort.


## Housekeeping
Your pull request should: 

* Include a description of what your change intends to do
* Be a child commit of a reasonably recent commit in the **master** branch 
    * Requests need not be a single commit, but should be a linear sequence of commits (i.e. no merge commits in your PR)
* It is desirable, but not necessary, for the tests to pass at each commit
* Have clear commit messages 
    * e.g. "Refactor feature", "Fix issue", "Add tests for issue"
* For code samples, please make sure they compile against the latest released TypeScript compiler version.

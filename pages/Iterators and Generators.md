# Symbols

Starting with ECMAScript 2015, `symbol` is a primitive data type, just like `number` and `string`.

`symbol` values are created by calling the `Symbol` constructor.

```ts
var sym1 = Symbol();

var sym2 = Symbol("key"); // optional string key
```

Symbols are immutable, and unique.

```ts
var sym2 = Symbol("key");
var sym3 = Symbol("key");

sym2 === sym3; // false, symbols are unique
```

Just like strings, symbols can be used as keys for object properties.

```ts
let sym = Symbol();

let obj = {};

obj[sym] = "value";
console.log(obj[sym]); // "value"
```

Symbols can also be combined with computed property declarations to declare object properties and class members.

```ts
const getClassNameSymbol = Symbol();

class C {
    [getClassNameSymbol](){
       return "C";
    }
}

let c = new C();
let className = c[getClassNameSymbol](); // "C"
```

## Well-known Symbols

In addition to user-defined symbols, there are well-known built-in symbols.
Built-in symbols are used to represent internal language behaviors.

Here is a list of well-known symbols:

### `Symbol.hasInstance`

A method that determines if a constructor object recognizes an object as one of the constructorâ€™s instances. Called by the semantics of the instanceof operator.

### `Symbol.isConcatSpreadable`

A Boolean value indicating that an object should be flatten to its array elements by Array.prototype.concat.

### `Symbol.iterator`

A method that returns the default iterator for an object. Called by the semantics of the for-of statement.

### `Symbol.match

A regular expression method that matches the regular expression against a string. Called by the `String.prototype.match` method.

### `Symbol.replace`

A regular expression method that replaces matched substrings of a string. Called by the `String.prototype.replace` method.

### `Symbol.search`

A regular expression method that returns the index within a string that matches the regular expression. Called by the `String.prototype.search` method.

### `Symbol.species`

A function valued property that is the constructor function that is used to create derived objects.

### `Symbol.split`

A regular expression method that splits a string at the indices that match the regular expression.
Called by the `String.prototype.split` method.

### `Symbol.toPrimitive`

A method that converts an object to a corresponding primitive value.
Called by the `ToPrimitive` abstract operation.

### `Symbol.toStringTag`

A String value that is used in the creation of the default string description of an object.
Called by the built-in method `Object.prototype.toString`.

### `Symbol.unscopables`

An Object whose own property names are property names that are excluded from the 'with' environment bindings of the associated objects.

# Iterables

An object is deemed iterable if it has an implementation for the `Symbol.iterator` property.
Some built-in types like `Array`, `Map`, `Set`, `String`, `Int32Array`, `Unint32Array`, etc. have their `Symbol.iterator` property already implemented.
`Symbol.iterator` function on an object is responsible for returning the list of values to iterate on.

## `for..of` statements

`for..of` loops over an iterable object, invoking the `Symbol.iterator` property on the object.
Here is a simple `for..of` loop on an array:

```ts
let someArray = [1, "string", false];

for (let entry of someArray) {
    console.log(entry); // 1, "string", false
}
```

### `for..of` vs. `for..in` statements

Both `for..of` and `for..in` statements iterate over lists; the values iterated on are different though, `for..in` returns a list of *keys* on the object being iterated, whereas `for..of` returns a list of *values* of the numeric properties of the object being iterated.

Here is an example that demonstrates this distinction:

```ts
let list = [4, 5, 6];

for (let i in list) {
   console.log(i); // "0", "1", "2",
}

for (let i of list) {
   console.log(i); // "4", "5", "6"
```

Another distinction is that `for..in` operates on any object; it serves as a way to inspect properties on this object.
`for..in` on the other hand, is mainly interested in values of iterable objects. Built-in objects like `Map` and `Set` implement `Symbol.iterator` property allowing access to stored values.

```ts
let pets = new Set(["Cat", "Dog", "Hamster"]);
pets["species"] = "mammals";

for (let pet in pets) {
   console.log(pet); // "species"
}

for (let pet of pets) {
    console.log(pet); // "Cat", "Dog", "Hamster"
}
```

### Code generation

#### Targeting ES5 and ES3

When targeting an ES5 or ES3, iterators are only allowed on values of `Array` type.
It is an error to use `for..of` loops on non-Array values, even if these non-Array values implement the `Symbol.iterator` property.

The compiler will generate a simple `for` loop for a `for..of` loop, for instance:

```ts
let numbers = [1, 2, 3];
for (let num of numbers) {
    console.log(num);
}
```

will be generated as:

```js
var numbers = [1, 2, 3];
for (var _i = 0; _i < numbers.length; _i++) {
    var num = numbers[_i];
    console.log(num);
}
```

#### Targeting ECMAScript 2015 and higher

When targeting an ECMAScipt 2015-compliant engine, the compiler will generate `for..of` loops to target the built-in iterator implementation in the engine.
